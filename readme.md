Physical Computing
==================

Lecturer: Julia Makivic

**Office Hours**

Thursday: 12pm - 4pm
Friday: 12pm - 4pm


## Week 1 (12/11/2019): Introduction to Physical Computing

**Links to Class Materials**

The Arduino Projects Book: [pdf](https://bastiaanvanhengel.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/arduino_projects_book.pdf)

The Spaceship Interface project is on pg. 33

**Homework**

Think of how you can expand on the “Spaceship Interface” exercise in the Arduino Projects book. How could you make an engaging interactive project using a few LEDS, a pushbutton and/or a tilt switch? Next week bring sketches/designs or prototypes of your ideas.


## Week 2 (19/11/2019)


**Note:** This week I am only having office hours on Friday

This week we will be going 

**Class Materials**

**Homework**

How can you create a new speculative design object using the sensors from lab? What would the object do? What physical, digital and “immaterial” materials would it use? What affordances would its material qualities provide and what sort of interaction would they enable?
Bonus: Research a new type of sensor on your own and create a speculative object that uses it.
