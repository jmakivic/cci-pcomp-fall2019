Physical Computing
==================

Lecturer: Julia Makivic

**Office Hours**

Thursday: 12pm - 4pm
Friday: 12pm - 4pm


## Week 1 (12/11/2019): Introduction to Physical Computing

**Links to Class Materials**

The Arduino Projects Book: [pdf](https://bastiaanvanhengel.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/arduino_projects_book.pdf)

The Spaceship Interface project is on pg. 33

**Homework**

Think of how you can expand on the “Spaceship Interface” exercise in the Arduino Projects book. How could you make an engaging interactive project using a few LEDS, a pushbutton and/or a tilt switch? Next week bring sketches/designs or prototypes of your ideas.


## Week 2 (19/11/2019)


**Note:** This week I am only having office hours on Friday

This week introduces programming RGB LEDs and using temperature and color sensors as inputs.

**Class Materials**

The Arduino Projects Book: [pdf](https://bastiaanvanhengel.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/arduino_projects_book.pdf)

Spaceship Interface: pg. 33


Love-O-Meter: pg.43


Color Mixing Lamp: pg. 53

**Homework**

How can you create a new speculative design object using the sensors from lab? What would the object do? What physical, digital and “immaterial” materials would it use? What affordances would its material qualities provide and what sort of interaction would they enable?
Bonus: Research a new type of sensor on your own and create a speculative object that uses it.

## Conductive Paint Workshop 25/11/2019

This workshop will cover the basics of using conductive paint to create touch and proximity sensors.

## Week 3 (26/11/2019)

This week will focus on the basics of creating sound with Arduino and piezos. We will learn how to use a piezo as a sensor for sound and vibrations. We will also learn how to read schematics.

**Class Materials**

The Arduino Projects Book: [pdf](https://bastiaanvanhengel.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/arduino_projects_book.pdf)

Schematic Symbols: pg. 10 -  Be sure to go over these in order to be able to read schematics

pg. 70 Light Theremin

pg. 78 Keyboard Instrument

pg. 124 Knock Lock - We did only part of this exercise this week, the rest will be completed next week. We put together everything on the circuit except for the servo motor and the blue capacitor.
